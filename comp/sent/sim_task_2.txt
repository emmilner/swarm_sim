'''
Swarm Warehouse with Boxes Code:
Displays a bird's eye view of a warehouse with robots moving around, avoiding the walls and each other. Boxes are picked up and moved to exit zone by robots. The boxes are requested to be delivered in a given sequence and that sequence is broadcast to the swarm. The robots will only pick up a box if it is the correct on in the sequence. They will then only pick up a new box when the sequence has moved on and the previous box has been delivered to the exit zone.

** Requires the script warehouse.py to be in the same folder as this script as it is called in the code **

Code authored by Emma Milner and Elliot Hogg

The actual specification for the Toshiba robots is as follows: 
agent speed = 2 m/s
agent acceleration 2 m/s/s
diameter of agent is 250 mm
width of warehouse is 5m
height (depth) of warehouse is 5m 
'''
# Still to do
	# Consider other exit zone options e.g. square in the centre (so that wall avoidance doesn't come in)
	# if delivered change the number of boxes.num_boxes so don't have to keep plotting them?
	# avoid boxes if you already have a box
